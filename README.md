# Programming Projects

This repository includes various programming projects that I have meticulously developed. Below are the details for each project, including instructions for usage and video links.

## 1. Connect Four Game

This project implements the popular **Connect Four** game. The game is developed in **C** language and includes multiple files to run the game smoothly.

### Files:
- **main.c**: The C language code for the game logic.
- **main.exe**: The executable file to run the game.
- **parameters.xml**: The XML configuration file containing parameters such as width, height, and the top player.

## 2. Maze Solver

This project is a **Maze Solver** that can solve a maze using two different algorithms: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. 

### How to Use:
1. Download and run the project.
2. Provide the path to your maze file. The project includes two test cases, one with a solvable maze and one without a solution.
3. Choose the solving method (BFS or DFS) and watch the program solve the maze.

## 3. Numerical Methods for Solving Linear and Non-Linear Equations

This project implements an **Equation Solver** that uses **Numerical Methods** to solve both **Linear** and **Non-Linear** equations. The solver is designed to find solutions to systems of linear and non-linear equations, providing the option to visualize the equations through plots.

### How to Use:
1. Enter the equation you wish to solve.
2. Fill in the required fields to specify the parameters of the equation.
3. Optionally, you can plot the equations to visualize the solutions.

## 4. Routh-Hurwitz Criteria

This project implements the **Routh-Hurwitz Criteria**, used to determine the stability of a control system.

### How to Use:
1. Input the characteristic equation of the system as shown in the sample runs.
   - Enter all coefficients (even if they are 1), and avoid using spaces.
2. The program will display the **Routh array**, system stability status, and the roots of the characteristic equation.
3. If the system is unstable, the program will list the number and values of poles in the right-half plane.
